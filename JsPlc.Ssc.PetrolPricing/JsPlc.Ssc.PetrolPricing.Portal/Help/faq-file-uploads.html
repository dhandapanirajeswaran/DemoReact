    <section id="FileTemplates">
        <h4>File Templates</h4>
        <p>For the main 3 File upload types (<a href="#QuarterlySiteData">Quarterly Site Data</a>, <a href="#LatestJsPriceData">Latest Js Price Data</a> and <a href="#LatestCompPriceData">Latest Competitor Price Data</a>) files
        there is a <button type="button"  class="btn btn-primary btn-sm"><i class="fa fa-download"></i> Download Data Template</button> button.
        This file should be downloaded, populated with the appropriate data and then uploaded into the system.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="DatePicker">
        <h4>Date Picker and Historical data</h4>

        <p>
            During normal usage the date picker will only appear when uploading a <a href="#DailyPriceData">Daily Price Data</a> file.
        </p>

        <p class="tip">
            You enable a date picker for all <a href="#FileUploadTypes">four Upload Types</a> using enabling the option on the <a href="/Settings">System Setting</a> page.
            This can be done to allow historical data to be uploaded in the system during <a href="help/faq-setting-up">initial setup</a> (or testing).
