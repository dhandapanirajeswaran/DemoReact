        <p>We can make further price decreases during the <strong>Price Freeze</strong></p>
        <p>A banner appears at the top of the <a href="/Sites/Prices">Pricing Page</a> indicating that a <strong>Price Freeze</strong> is active and how many days are remaining.</p>

        </p>

        <p class="notes">
            You cannot trigger a recalculation of prices when viewing Historical data since the prices have already been sent out to the Sainsburys fuel sites.

    <section id="ExcludedBrands">
        <h4>Excluded Brands</h4>
        <p>
            These are <strong>Brands</strong> which we wish to ignore when searching through the Competitor to find the cheapest price.

            The Competitor Modal can be access on the <a href="/Sites/Prices">Pricing page</a> by clicking on a Sainsbury's Store Name.
            Its purpose is to show which competitor was chosen (if any) for each fuel type.
        </p>
        <p>
            The modal itself shows all the surrounding Competitors (including other Sainsburys sites) with (for example) <strong>25 minutes Drive Time</strong>.
            Each of the 3 Fuel grades (Unleaded, Diesel, and Super-Unleaded) are displayed with their prices for the previous <strong>two days</strong> (Day -1 and Day -2).
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
            For each fuel type the age of the Fuel price is displayed (e.g. 3d = 3 days or 'X' no price available).
        </p>
        <p class="note">

        <h5>Filters and Toggles</h5>

        <p>
            At the bottom of the Competitor Modal are a series of filters and toggle buttons these affect how the
            Competitors are display (or hidden).
        </p>

        <p>
            For Example, the <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs"><i class="fa fa-rss-square"></i> Inside</button>
            and <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs"><i class="fa fa-square-o"></i> Outside</button> will hide or show Competitors depending if they are inside or outside the <a href="#NearbyGrocer">Nearby Grocer</a> <a href="#DriveTime">Drive Time</a>

        </p>

        <p>
            The <strong>Price Match Type</strong> is managed on a site-by-site basis and can changed by choosing a site from the <a href="/Sites">Sites Management</a> page.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="NearbyGrocer">

        </p>

        <p class="note">

        </p>

        <p class="tip">
            You can change the X minutes drive time threshold in the <a href="/Settings">Settings</a> page using the

        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="BulkOverride">
        <h4>Bulk Override</h4>

        <p>
            A <strong>Bulk</strong> (aka Mass) Override is entered on the <a href="/Sites/Prices">Pricing Page</a> under each of
            the 3 Fuel signs and will set the <a href="#Override">Override</a> Price for a single fuel for <strong>ALL sites</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="fuel-sign fuel-sign-unleaded"></span> &mdash;
            <span class="fuel-sign fuel-sign-diesel"></span> &mdash;
            <span class="fuel-sign fuel-sign-super-unleaded"></span>
        </p>

        <p>
            There are <strong>two modes</strong> of entering a Bulk Override, these are...
        </p>

        <dl class="glossary-list">
            <dt>
                (+/-n)
            </dt>
            <dd>This is a small increase/decrease value (E.g. <code>-2.0</code> will move all the Prices down by <code>2.0p</code>)</dd>

            <dt>
                <i class="fa fa-gbp"></i>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                This will set the <strong>Absolute</strong> Price for <strong>all the sites</strong> (E.g. <code>109.0</code> will set all the sites to the price <code>&pound;109.00</code>)
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </section>

    <section id="TodayAndTomorrow">
        <h4>Today And Tomorrow Prices</h4>

        <p>
            <strong>Today</strong> prices are the prices which are currently displayed at each Sainsburys fuel site
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Tomorrow</strong> prices are the <strong>Suggested</strong> (aka Auto) price which have been calculated
            by looking at all the surrounding Competitor fuel prices for that particular site. <strong>Drive Time markup</strong> is
            applied when finding the cheapest price and is based on the <a href="/Settings/DriveTime">Drive Time markup</a> values.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Override</strong> prices are <strong>user</strong> entered prices and will be used instead of the Suggested/Auto price.
        </p>

        <p>
            Either the <strong>Override</strong> or <strong>Suggested Tomorrow</strong> price will be sent out to each Sainsburys fuel site via email.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="PriceMatchType">
        <h4>Price Match Type (aka Site Price Strategy)</h4>
        <p>
            This is the strategy of how a Sainsburys <a href="#SuggestedPrice">Suggested Price</a> is calculated from surrounding <a href="#Competitor">Competitors</a> (normally within 25 minutes drive time).
        </p>

        <p>There are currently 3 types of Price Match Types</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Standard</dt>
            <dd>
                The Standard takes the cheapest Competitor price for each <a href="#FuelType">Fuel Type</a> &mdash;
                <a href="#DriveTimeMarkup">Drive Time Markup</a> is added to this base price.
            </dd>

            <dt>Trial Price</dt>
            <dd>
                The Trial Price takes the cheapest Competitor price for each Fuel Type and then applies an additional <a href="#Markup">Markup</a> (E.g. +2.0p) &mdash;
                <a href="#DriveTimeMarkup">Drive Time Markup</a> is added to this base price.
            </dd>

            <dt>Match Competitor</dt>
            <dd>
                The Match Competitor uses a <strong>one, fixed</strong> Competitor to use as its base price (other Competitors are <strong>not</strong> used) then an additional markup is applied.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <p class="note">
            <strong>Match Competitor</strong> does <strong>not</strong> apply <a href="#DriveTimeMarkup">Drive Time Markup</a> based on the amount of Drive Time/Distance from the Sainsburys site to the Matched Competitor&mdash;
            It is up to the user to specific the total markup in the Match Competitor +/- value.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="SiteEmails">
        <h4>Site Emails</h4>
        <p>
            For each Sainsburys site fuel price change an email will be sent out to that fuel site <strong>only</strong> if there is a price change for
            any of the 3 fuel types.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
            It is possible that very small changes in fuel prices (such as <code>+0.1p</code> or <code>-0.7p</code>) might be ignored depending on the
            <a href="/Settings">Price Change Variance</a> value. If the change is <strong>within this Price Variance</strong> then the price is <strong>Snapped back</strong>
            to the <a href="#TodayAndTomorrow">Today Price</a>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="SuggestedPrice">
        |<h4>Suggested Price</h4>

        <p>
            This is the <strong>Suggested</strong> (aka the <strong>Auto</strong>) Price and is used when calculating the <a href="#TodayAndTomorrow">Tomorrow Price</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The price itself is built on some complex pricing logic which is based on surrounding <a href="#Competitor">Competitors</a>, their <a href="#DriveTime">Drive Time</a> distance and the <a href="#FuelType">Fuel Type</a>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="AbsoluteMinMax">
        <h4>Absolute Min/Max Prices</h4>

        <p>
            You can only enter <a href="#FuelPrice">Fuel Prices</a> between a <strong>min</strong> and <strong>max</strong> range.
            This helps to prevent user errors when entering <a href="#Override">Override Prices</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            You <strong>cannot</strong> enter a value smaller than the <strong>Min</strong> value or higher than the <strong>Max</strong> limit.
        </p>

        <p class="tip">
            The <strong>Absolute Min/Max Prices</strong> are managed on the <a href="/Settings">Settings</a> page for each Fuel Type.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="WarningIndicators">
        <h4>Warning Indicators</h4>

        <p>
            When entering a <a href="#BulkOverride">Bulk Override</a> the UI will warning you if you are entering a price change
            which it outside a certain range. You are still free to make the price change.
