        <h4>Clearing down the data</h4>
        <p>
            Certain users (with relevant permissions) can clear down the data within the system itself.
            This is done on <a href="/Diagnostics">Diagnostics</a> page.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
            This feature is intended for testing and the initial setup of the Petrol Pricing tool and <strong>not</strong>
            for the day-to-day usage since any existing data is erased and <strong>cannot</strong> be recovered.

        <h4>Loading Seed Data</h4>
        <p>After the system has had its data cleared down you will need to upload the seed data.
        This "seed" data is the Quarterly Site Data file along with any Historic Daily Price Data (aka Catalist) files.
        </p>

        <p>You can upload these files on the <a href="/File/Upload">File upload</a> page</p>
